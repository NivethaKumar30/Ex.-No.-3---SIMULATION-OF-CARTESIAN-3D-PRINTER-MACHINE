Smooth Rod : a metal rod usually used on the axis for components such as the X-carriage or print bed of a RepRap to slide 

Bearing : a machine element that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces friction between moving parts

Idler :a gear wheel that is inserted between two or more other gear wheels

Extruder: a metal forming process in which metal or work piece is forced to flow through a die to reduce its cross section or convert it into desire shape

Motor: a device for converting electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of rotation.
n engineering mechanics, a motor is a device that converts electrical or mechanical energy into rotational or linear motion. Motors play a crucial role in various applications across different industries, including manufacturing, transportation, robotics, and automation. They are used to generate mechanical power and drive machinery, equipment, and systems.
